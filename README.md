## Overview
A perennial debate in college football is whether the "best" teams should be ranked above the "most deserving" teams. Different models take different positions on this issue. Some, like [ESPN's FPI](http://www.espn.com/college-football/statistics/teamratings), attempt to find the true strength of teams in order to predict the results of future games. Others, such as [Colley](https://www.colleyrankings.com), reward teams for their wins and penalize them for their losses. This ranking is a simple attempt at combining these two approaches. At the beginning of the season, this ranking is identical to the FPI ranking, but as more games are played in the season, a team's record is given more and more weight.
